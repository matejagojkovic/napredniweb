Germany and the other losing nations had no voice which gave rise to political resentments that lasted for decades."

The senators claimed to be acting over fears that Caesar's unprecedented concentration of power during his dictatorship was undermining the Roman Republic, and presented the deed as an act of tyrannicide. At least 60 senators were party to the conspiracy, led by Marcus Junius Brutus, Gaius Cassius Longinus and Decimus Junius Brutus. Despite the death of Caesar, the conspirators were unable to restore the institutions of the Republic.
